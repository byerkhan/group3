The membership application is present here.
To start it, you need to do the following:

* git clone repo

* Go to the personal_account directory (write cd personal_account in bash or open bash inside this directory).
Next, install node_modules:
### `npm install`
##
* Now we launch our React application using 3rd bash (should be in personal_account directory):
### `npm start`
Note: React application runs locally on port 3000.
